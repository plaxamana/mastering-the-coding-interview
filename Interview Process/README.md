# Cracking the Phone Screen

You get on the telephone and you talk with the company whether you get hired or not. The company sends you a homework assignment and if you pass, then they will get on a phone call with you to talk more about your experience.

The homework assignments can be a pain. They can take a lot of time (you can spend half a day or even a whole day on it). Intentionally allocate time to complete the homework assignments. It can take even a whole weekend. Set the expectation that you will need to set aside time to do these.

In these assignments, they want to see your coding style and see that you're following the standard style guide.

Check the style guide at Google: [Google Style Guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/)

They're meant to filter out candidates.

- Didn't submit the assignment? Filtered out.
- Didn't follow best practices when writing your code? Filtered out.
- Misspellings? Not using designs (like OOP)? Filtered out.

Two different types of phone screens:

## The Recruiter Call

(they aren't technical people, call shouldn't be intimidating). They ask basic HR questions.

- Work Authorization Status?
- What types of teams are you interested in?
- What your leveling may be?
- What type of conpensation are you looking for?
- Your timeline?

Recruiters are the gatekeepers between you and the interview. You need to convey to the recruiter that you are able to pass that interview. You need to convey confidence in the role you're applying for.

They're trying to understand the technical interest that you have.

Some questions that they might ask you over the phone can be quick fire:

- What is a boolean?
- What's a closure in javascript?
- What's your favorite programming language?

Tailor yourself for the role you're applying for. Do a quick search for common interview questions for the niche you're in (for example: JavaScript).

## The Engineering Manager Call

This is the type of person that can talk code with you. You might be expected to write code with them over the phone on CoderPad or a Google Doc. Don't take this lightly as failing this one means you won't be able to move forward with the interview process. An engineer (or engineering manager) might just be assigned to conduct an interview (whether phone or onsite), and they're responsible for determining whether you pass or fail the interview.

You still need to perform the same as if you are getting onsite.

- Proper Big O time space analysis
- show good coding style
- proper communication
- time management

If its a phone coding interview, make sure you have a headset so that you can turn up the volume to hear the interviewer clearly.

## **Main Points**

- **Know your Resume**: Do not under-estimate the phone-screen. While sometimes it is conducted by a non-technical recruiter, at companies like Google it is conducted by the same engineers who may be conducting the on-sites (and while expectations are lower, they may still ask the same tough questions as an on-site!). Be sure to be able to impress quickly.

  - One big piece of advice here is to show confidence. Many candidates aren't prepared, can't talk smoothly, are stuttering or too shy. Especially on the phone, it is hard to gauge whether the candidate is even still there or listening, or whether they're shy & quivering. Let your enthusiasm show!

  - Keep time-management in-mind. Phone interviews generally have a time limit, so keep the chit-chat minimal (unless it's with a recruiter). This is still an interview, where time-management is essential.

  - Pick 1-2 projects that you'll be able to explain strongly. The more current, the better. If they ask "So how are you, what have you been up to? Tell me where you're at now..." Prepare an answer for this.

- **Research the Company**: Even though you are early in your job hunt, to the interviewer they don't feel that this is early at all. So, you need to be as prepared as if you were going in to the on-site. Research the company and know the role well.

- **Prepare for smoke screens**: Depending on your chosen field, prepare for smoke-screen questions. These are often quick "yes/no" type of questions on common tricks. In Javascript, it would be questions like "What is a closure?" while in iOS it is "What is a memory cycle?" or "How is a block different from a delegate?"

- **Prepare for common questions**

  - Why do you want to work here?
  - What projects have you done?
  - What is your visa status?
  - Why did you leave your last job?
  - What are you looking for?
  - Do you want full-time or part-time?
  - What type of role do you want?

- **Stay enthusiastic** - I know that sometimes you can feel down about your job hunt. No matter what, stay enthusiastic. This is all part of "playing the game." Let a bit of humor show. Most candidates are _scared stiff_, since the phone-screen weeds out probably 90% of people. Think of it from the perspective of the interviewer -- _"Oh, great, another candidate who is super nervous to get a call from "famous tech company". Probably unqualified..."_ So, show a bit of humor, suave & confidence so they don't bucket you into that group.

- **Take notes** - During the phone screen, you'll be able to take notes. It's great to keep notes on the interviewer's name & role, so you can later ask questions about their position. Keep a pen and notepad handy.

- **Speak clearly and concisely** - Since the interviewer can't see you, pay extra attention to speaking fluidly.
  You only need to show potential - Don't sweat it if you can't ace everything. Usually for the phone-screen, expectations are lower and if you can show you have potential, that may be sufficient. Focus on demonstrating your analytical ability (as well as a cordial personality) - there is more leeway here on your code not looking its greatest over the phone.
